### Instructions:

1. In this game, the player will have to guess the answer, just like in Word Guess. This time, though, the player will guess
with numbers instead of letters.

2. There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

3. The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

4. When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.
The game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal. When they do click one, a counter will update the player's score.

5. The player will win the game if his/her total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

6. The player will lose if his/her score goes above the random number.

7. When the player wins or loses, the game will automatically restart in 3 second.

8. When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals
will have new hidden values, and the score counter will reset to zero. However, the number of games the players wins and loses will remain and be updated at the end of each game.
